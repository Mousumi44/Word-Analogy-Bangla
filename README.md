# Word-Analogy-Bangla
This repository contains the dataset and code for our EMNLP 2023 paper "**On Evaluation of Bangla Word Analogies**".

We provide a Mikolov-style word-analogy evaluation set specifically for Bangla, with a sample size of 16678, as well as a translated and curated version of the Mikolov dataset, which contains 10594 samples for cross-lingual research.
