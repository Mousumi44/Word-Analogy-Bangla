The word "হাতি" (hati) means "elephant", and the word "হাতিতে" (hatite) means "in an elephant". The word "রাত্রি" (ratri) is the feminine form of the word "রাত" (raat), and it means "night". So, the word analogy is saying that "night" is to "elephant" as "night" is to "in an elephant". The top 10 words for wordD are all words that are related to the concept of "night" in Bengali, and they are all derived from the word "রাত" (raat).

In this case, the affix is "তে". WordC is the word that is added to wordA to create wordB. In this case, the word that is added is "মধু". Therefore, wordD is the word that is created by removing the affix from wordB and adding the wordC. In this case, wordD is "মধুতে".  I hope this is what you were looking for.

This is because the relationship type "Affix_বিভক্তি" refers to the process of adding affixes to words to change their meaning or grammatical function. In this case, the affixes "-রা", "-দের", "-কে", "-তে", "-ন", "-নি", "-টি", "-রাই", and "-দের" are all used to form plural nouns, possessive nouns, accusative pronouns, locative pronouns, feminine nouns, neuter nouns, demonstrative pronouns, plural possessive nouns, and plural accusative pronouns, respectively.

The affix "-তে" (which means "in") is added to the word "রাত্রি" (which means "night") to form the word "রাত্রিতে" (which means "at night").

The other words in the list are also derived from the root word "রাত" by adding different affixes. Each affix indicates a different grammatical function. For example, the affix "-কাল" indicates that the word is in the temporal case, which means that it refers to a time. In this case, the word "রাত্রিকাল" refers to the time of night.

This is because the relationship type "Affix_বিভক্তি" is used to find words that have the same root word but with different affixes.

An affix is a word that is added to the beginning, end, or middle of another word to change its meaning. In this case, the affix being added is the case marker "কে" (ke), which indicates that the word is the indirect object of the sentence. Therefore, all of the words in the output are the indirect object of the sentence "শিশুকে দরিদ্র" (shishuke doridr), which means "the child is poor."

In this case, the affix is "কে". WordC is the word that is similar to wordA in the same way that wordB is similar to wordD. In this case, wordC is "আমি".  The top 10 words for wordD are all words that are similar to "শিশু" in the same way that "শিশুকে" is similar to "আমি".

In this case, the affixes are "দরি" and "কে". The word "দরিদ্র" is the base word, and the words "দরিদ্রকে" and "আমি" are derived words. The word "দরিদ্র" is in the nominative case, the word "দরিদ্রকে" is in the accusative case, and the word "আমি" is in the nominative case.

The model was trained on a massive dataset of Bangla text, and it is able to represent the meaning of words in a way that is similar to how humans understand them. This allows the model to generate words that are semantically related to the given words.  In this case, the relationship type is "Affix_বিভক্তি". This means that we are looking for a word that is derived from wordB by adding the affix "এর". The affix "এর" is a possessive marker, and it is used to indicate possession or ownership. In this case, the word "লাউয়ের" is the possessive form of the word "লাউ". This means that "লাউয়ের" refers to the "লাউ" of someone or something.  The other two words in the analogy are "লাউ" and "বউ". The word "লাউ" is a noun that refers to a type of gourd. The word "বউ" is a noun that refers to a wife.  The top 10 words for wordD are all related to the word "লাউ".
