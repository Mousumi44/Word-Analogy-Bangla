Sure, I can do that. Here are the top 10 words for wordD in the following Mikolov-style word analogy:  ```   ```  ``` [1] সুন্দর [2] শ্রেষ্ঠ [3] উৎকৃষ্ট [4] উত্তম [5] উন্নত [6] সমৃদ্ধ [7] সমুন্নত [8] ঐশ্বর্যশালী [9] বিপুল [10] অঢেল ```  These words were chosen based on their similarity to the given words in the analogy. For example, the word "সুন্দর" (beautiful) is similar to the word "ভালো" (good) because they both describe something that is pleasing to the eye. The word "শ্রেষ্ঠ" (best) is similar to the word "বড়তর" (bigger) because they both describe something that is of a higher quality or degree.

They are all related to the concept of size, but they also have other connotations, such as value, importance, and worth. For example, ছোট (small) can also mean insignificant, while কম (less) can also mean inferior.  I hope this is what you were looking for. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

For example, "ছোট" means "small", "ক্ষুদ্র" means "tiny", and "অল্প" means "little". All of these words are less than "বড়" and "বড়তর", which means "big" and "bigger" respectively.

Sure, I can do that. Here are the top 10 words for wordD in the following analogy:  ```   ```  ``` 1. সুমধুর 2. মিষ্টি 3. মিষ্ট 4. রসালো 5. রসাল 6. কোমল 7. নরম 8. স্নিগ্ধ 9. কোমলমধুর 10. মধুরতম ```  These words are all similar to মধুর in the sense that they are all synonyms for "sweet". However, they each have their own unique nuances that make them slightly different from মধুর. For example, সুমধুর is more intense and flavorful than মধুর, while মিষ্টি is more general and can be used to describe a wider range of things.  I hope this is helpful!

Here are the top 10 words for wordD in the following analogy:  ```   ```  * উন্নততর * উৎকৃষ্টতর * শ্রেষ্ঠতর * বর্ধিততর * বৃহত্তর * বিশালতর * প্রভূতর * মহত্তর * মহৎতর * উচ্চতর  These words are all comparative adjectives in Bengali, and they all represent a higher degree of the quality or attribute that is being compared. For example, "বড়" means "big", "বড়তর" means "bigger", and "শ্রেয়" means "better". So, the analogy is saying that "শ্রেয়" is to "বড়" as "বড়তর" is to "বড়". This means that "শ্রেয়" is a higher degree of the quality of "big" than "বড়" is.  I hope this is what you were looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions.

They are all used to describe something that is longer than something else. For example, you could say that a building is দীর্ঘ (long) if it is taller than other buildings in the area. You could also say that a river is বিশাল (huge) if it is wider and longer than other rivers.  I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

This means that wordB is more similar to wordC than wordA is. * WordA is "সুন্দর" (beautiful). * WordB is "সুন্দরতর" (more beautiful). * WordC is "শীতল" (cool). * WordD is the word that is more similar to "সুন্দরতর" than "সুন্দর" is.

However, they also have additional qualities that make them even more beautiful or good. For example, "নির্মল" means "pure" or "unpolluted", which implies that something is not only beautiful, but also clean and free of impurities. Similarly, "পবিত্র" means "holy" or "sacred", which implies that something is not only beautiful, but also has a special religious or spiritual significance.

Sure, I can do that. Here are the top 10 words for the word `মন্দ` in the comparative relationship to `বড়` and `বড়তর`:  ``` খারাপ নিকৃষ্ট হীন অপমানজনক ঘৃণ্য তুচ্ছ নিন্দনীয় অপমানিত অতিরূপ অসম্ভব ```  These words are all similar to `মন্দ` in that they all express negative qualities or characteristics. For example, `খারাপ` means "bad", `নিকৃষ্ট` means "inferior", and `হীন` means "worthless". These words can all be used to describe something that is worse than something else, which is the relationship that is being expressed in the analogy.  I hope this is helpful!

For example, উষ্ণ (warm) is more similar to মধুর than শীতল, and গরম (hot) is even more similar to মধুর. These words can be used to create more complex analogies, such as:  ``` {Comparative} শীতলতর - শীতল = মধুর + উষ্ণ ```  This analogy states that the difference between শীতলতর (cooler) and শীতল (cold) is equal to the sum of মধুর (sweet) and উষ্ণ (warm). This can be interpreted as meaning that something that is cooler than cold is also sweeter and warmer than cold.

For example, "পূর্ণ" (full) is compared to "পূর্ণতর" (more full), which is then compared to "ভালো" (good). This analogy shows that something that is more full is considered to be of a higher quality.  I hope this is what you were looking for. Let me know if you have any other questions.

For example, বৃহৎ and বৃহত্তর are both adjectives that mean "large". উচ্চ is also an adjective that means "high", and it is similar to বৃহত্তর in the sense that something that is high is also likely to be large. The other words on the list are also similar to বৃহত্তর in terms of meaning, size, or scope.

In other words, they all express a greater degree of the quality that is being compared. For example, লঘুতর means "less heavy" than বৃহৎ, ক্ষুদ্র means "smaller" than বৃহৎ, and অল্প means "fewer" than বৃহৎ.  I hope this is what you were looking for.

For example, "মহৎ" can be used to describe someone who is great or noble, while "মহত্তর" can be used to describe something that is even greater or more noble. "ভালো" can be used to describe something that is good, pleasant, or desirable. In the comparative relationship, these words can be used to compare two things to see which one is better. For example, "মহৎ" is better than "ভালো", while "মহত্তর" is better than both "মহৎ" and "ভালো".

Here are the top 10 words for wordD in the analogy  :  ``` বড় বৃহৎ প্রধান উচ্চ বিশাল প্রশস্ত সুন্দর উত্তম শ্রেষ্ঠ মহাজী ```  These words are all comparative adjectives that express the idea of being greater than something else. For example, মহৎ means "great" and মহত্তর means "greater". So, the wordD in the analogy   would be a word that means "greater than great". The top 10 words listed above are all possible answers for wordD.

Sure, here are the top 10 words for wordD in the given input:  ```    1. উন্নত 2. উচ্চ 3. শ্রেষ্ঠ 4. বড় 5. সমৃদ্ধ 6. সুন্দর 7. আকর্ষণীয় 8. বিখ্যাত 9. প্রসিদ্ধ 10. খ্যাতনামা ```  These words are all related to the concept of being "greater" or "more important" than মহৎ (mahāto), which means "great" or "noble". মহত্তর (mahottaro) means "greater" or "more noble", and মধুর (mudur) means "sweet" or "pleasant". The top 10 words are all related to these concepts in some way. For example, উন্নত (unnoto) means "advanced" or "developed", which is a way of saying that something is greater than something else. উচ্চ (uchcho) means "high", which can be seen as a way of saying that something is more important than something else. শ্রেষ্ঠ (shersho) means "best", which is another way of saying that something is greater than something else.

They are all related to the word "অল্প", which means "small" or "little". The word "মহৎ" means "great" or "significant", and the word "মহত্তর" means "greater". So, the analogy is saying that "মহত্তর" is to "মহৎ" as "অল্প" is to "wordD". This means that "wordD" must be a word that represents a degree of smallness or insignificance that is greater than that of "অল্প". The words in the list above all meet this criteria.

They are all either synonyms of "cold" or they are words that are related to "cold" in some way. For example, "ঠান্ডা" is the direct Bangla translation of the English word "cold." "ঠাণ্ডা" is a more colloquial form of "ঠান্ডা." "শীতলতর" means "colder." "শীতলতম" means "coldest." "ঠান্ডাতর" means "more cold." "ঠাণ্ডাতম" means "most cold." "লম্বা" means "long."

They are also all comparative in nature, meaning that they compare one thing to another. For example, দীর্ঘতর is a comparative adjective that means "longer." So, in this analogy, দীর্ঘ is being compared to দীর্ঘতর, and মন্দ is being compared to the unknown wordD. The top 10 words for wordD are all words that are similar to মন্দ in meaning and in their comparative nature.

Sure, I can do that.  Here are the top 10 words for wordD in the following analogy:  ```   ```  ``` 1. মিষ্টি 2. কম 3. নরম 4. হালকা 5. মসৃণ 6. কোমল 7. স্নিগ্ধ 8. তেলতেলে 9. চকচকে 10. উজ্জ্বল ```  These words are all related to the concept of "sweetness" in some way.

Sure, I can do that.

This is because the comparative relationship type indicates that wordD is a word that is more similar to wordB than wordA. In this case, wordB is "প্রিয়তর" and wordA is "প্রিয়". Therefore, wordD must be a word that is more beloved than "প্রিয়".

The second word, প্রিয়তর (priyotar), means "dearer" or "beloved more". The third word, খারাপ (kharaap), means "bad".

The word "গরম" (which means "hot") is the most similar to the word "প্রিয়তর" (which means "dearer"), so it is ranked first. The other words are all less similar to "প্রিয়তর", but they are still related to heat and temperature.

For example, wordC is "পূর্ণ" (full), which is similar to wordA "প্রিয়" (dear) in the sense that both words are positive and have a strong emotional connotation. WordB is "প্রিয়তর" (dearer), which is one degree more positive than wordA. Therefore, wordD should be one degree more positive than wordC. The top 10 words that I have listed all meet this criteria.

In this case, wordA is লঘু (light), wordB is লঘীয়ান (lighter), and wordC is লম্বা (long). Therefore, wordD is the word that is both lighter and longer than লঘু. The top 10 words that fit this description are the ones listed above.

When we subtract লঘু from লঘীয়ান and add সুন্দর, we get the word মধুর, which means "sweet." This makes sense because sweetness is often associated with beauty. The other words on the list are all related to beauty in some way, such as কোমল (soft), স্নিগ্ধ (smooth), নরম (soft), মসৃণ (smooth), তেজস্বী (bright), উজ্জ্বল (bright), চকচকে (shiny), ঝকঝকে (sparkling), and ঝকমক (glitter).
