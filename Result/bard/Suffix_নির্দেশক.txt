I have considered the following factors in my selection:  * The relationship between wordA and wordB. In this case, wordB is the suffix "টা" which is used to indicate a small amount of something. WordA is the word "ছেলে" which means "boy". Therefore, wordD should be a word that means "boy" and has the suffix "টা". * The meaning of wordC. In this case, wordC is the word "কিছু" which means "some". Therefore, wordD should be a word that means "boy" and is related to the concept of "some". * The frequency of use of words in Bangla. I have chosen the most common words that meet the above criteria.  I hope this is helpful!
